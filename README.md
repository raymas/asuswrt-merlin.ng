# asuswrt-merlin New Gen (version 382.xx and higher)

Fork of [RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng)

## Custom builds (raymas)

Wireguard implementation for asuswrt-merlin work in progress

## Edited packages

Most of supported routers are using kernel 2.6. Since the wireguard kernel implementation requires 3.10 and higher, we must use the wireguard-go userspace.

For HND hardwares which are using kernel 4.1.27, we should be able to use the kernel module.


## Status
